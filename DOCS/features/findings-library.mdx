description: "Managing finding templates with the Finding Library"
---

The Findings Library lives at `/reporting/findings/`. The library is where users can view and edit finding templates for use in reports. Adding a finding to the library makes it available to all users. The library is intended to be the "source of truth" for your team when it comes to templates.

## AI Integration

Ghostwriter now includes a basic integration with large language models. If you
set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable, you can run the management command
`generate_ai_finding` to create finding text using an LLM. The command will
prompt the model with your text and optionally create a new finding record.

```bash
python manage.py generate_ai_finding "Prompt describing the finding" --create
```

<Note>
Make sure everyone is aware that editing a finding in the library *changes it for everyone*. Edits for a specific project/report should be made after the finding is added to the report. Then edit the report's "local" copy.
